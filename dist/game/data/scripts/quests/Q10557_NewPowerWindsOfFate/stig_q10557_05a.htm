<html><body>Balthus Knight Captain Stig Mach:<br>
I knew you were interested in gaining greater power and working in a wider world. I noticed a new Power of Wind from you when you fought Antharas. I thought over how to help you assimilate that power, but there was nothing much I could do because I'm an Ertheian. So, I asked your queen, Navari, for help, and she readily accepted my request.<br>
I will send you back to your queen so that you can liberate your power to use it in this continent.<br>
I'm sure you will be an invaluable resource to the Balthus Knights, but I shouldn't confine you here. You are meant to make heroic feats in a bigger world. Maybe one day, we will meet again and fight together against Antharas. Now, are you ready to gain greater power?<br>

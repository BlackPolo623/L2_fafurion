<html><body>Balthus Knight Captain Stig Mach:<br>
Without your help during the last Antharas expedition, the Balthus Knights would have suffered more serious damage. You saved all of us. We will prepare ourselves more thoroughly to lead the next Antharas expedition to victory.<br>
I'd like to ask you to stay in the Balthus Knights, but you have greater potential. If you make further progress here, you will be able to rise to my position and command the knights. However, after long consideration, I concluded that it would be unwise to confine you in the Balthus Knight.<br>
You have potential to make your name in a wider world. To do so, you should leave the Balthus Knights and obtain greater power.<br>

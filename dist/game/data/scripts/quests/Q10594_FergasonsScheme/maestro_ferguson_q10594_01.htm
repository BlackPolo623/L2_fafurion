Hmm... Are you familiar with the Seed of Hellfire? I've lived here for a long time but still don't understand their social structure.<br>
That's not my concern, though. I've tried to build friendly relations with them to get what I need from them. If you need anything, tell me. I may be able to help you.<br>

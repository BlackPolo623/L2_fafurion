You came back. It wasn't difficult, was it? We don't need to arouse any suspicion. Now, go to meet <font color="LEVEL">Aku</font>.<br>
I already sent a message to Aku. He must be waiting for you.<br>
To meet Aku, go to the <font color="LEVEL">South of the Seed of Hellfire</font> through the <font color="LEVEL">Transportation Assistant</font>.<br>
After meeting Aku, kill about 200 monsters here in the Seed of Hellfire.<br>
I know it's a little cumbersome, but you should make them believe you're working on something. On that note, I'll see you later.

The Balthus Knight procures supplies from the inside because the items Camcud makes are far better than what can be purchased outside. Camcud is cautious, so he gives supply items only to those he trusts. Here is the list of the supplies I need. Show this list to Camcud, and he will give you the supplies, then, deliver them to Stig Mach. What you have to do is to impress Camcud, who will make supply items for you. That's my last test.

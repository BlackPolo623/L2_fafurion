Ah, Sibis? Right, he said that the quartermaster would procure the supplies I needed. This must be what I requested for. Thank you for delivering it personally. This is why it's great to have friends.<br>
You have one more. Is it for the Grand Master?<br>
Rumor has it that the Knight is soon leaving to hunt down Antharas. That scary dragon must be very powerful. Otherwise, I guess it wouldn't be called a boss.<br>
You'd better deliver the item to the Grand Master quickly. He many need it to defeat Antharas.

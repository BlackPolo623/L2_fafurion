Hmm... this is a list of supplies requested by Captain Stig. I don't understand why Stig and McCoy always send people to get supplies instead of coming themselves.<br>
But seeing the list explains why. I'll bring the supplies on the list, so make sure you deliver them safely.<br>
Oh, there is someone else who hasn't received his supplies. I think he's your friend... Would you deliver them to your friend?<br>
This base is so small that everyone knows who is where. But the Aden Continent is too large. It is often very difficult to locate a region or person. That's why you need a <font color="LEVEL">map</font>. I recommend you to learn how to read the map.<br>
Oh, your friend is over there. His name is... Tarti! Right? Go to him.

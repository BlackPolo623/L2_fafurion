Some of the necessary items can be purchased from Traders. It is also possible for you to sell your items. Currently, all the necessary things are made and supplied by me. But later, this information will be very important so don't forget it.<br>
Wait, I've talked a lot, but there is one more very important thing. <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font> are very important. Soulshots and Spiritshots temporarily boost the performance of a weapon with the energy of Spirits. They are crucial when we are in battle.<br>
Of course, Traders sell Spiritshots and Soulshots. But I don't think they handle Soulshots and Spiritshots that are appropriate for you. So, we have to order them from Blacksmiths.<br>

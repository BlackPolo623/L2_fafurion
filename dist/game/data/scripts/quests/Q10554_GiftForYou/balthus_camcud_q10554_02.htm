Did McCoy give you the responsibility of delivering Supply Items? Let me see... Oh, I can't believe it's true. That picky McCoy trusts you!<br>
Do you know how important supply items are? I make most of the items we need. To fight against the enemies, we need weaponry. Blacksmiths, like me, make the weapons.<br>
That's not all. We also make armor to defend against attacks from the enemies. Armor is also made by Blacksmiths.<br>
Of course, just making it isn't enough. There are other important things.<br>

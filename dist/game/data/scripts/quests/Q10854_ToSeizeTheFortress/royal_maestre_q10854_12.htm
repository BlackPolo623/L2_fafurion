To achieve our objectives, we must take out Commander Burnstein. It appears that Burnstein is still alive and well. Please go and defeat Burnstein.<br>
Note that Burnstein on the third level of the fortress, when threatened, retreats to the Command Post. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font>, and slay Burnstein in there.

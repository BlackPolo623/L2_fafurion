Aren't you in the middle of an operation right now? Though I've got my hands full with defending the stronghold, I'm not entirely clueless as to the situation. <br>
If you're slacking off, my spirits wont have any of that. A lot of people are waiting intently, so hurry up and wrap the operation up!

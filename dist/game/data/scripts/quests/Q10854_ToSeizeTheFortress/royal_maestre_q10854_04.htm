You can say we already have a fair amount of information on Atelia Fortress.<br>
Though it's not enough, there was quite a bit of information that the Aden Vanguard discovered after arriving here earlier than we did. Thanks to your help, we have been able to cause the Embryo some trouble as well.<br>
We are about the start our operations to take control of Atelia Fortress in earnest now. Before unleashing the full force of the Kingdom's Royal Guard, we will send a few elite soldiers to confuse the Embryo.<br>

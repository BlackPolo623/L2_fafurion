The atmosphere about you tells me you're a friend. It's a good thing to have a friend one can trust.<br>
Well, I can't say I love the way the Kingdom's Royal Guard is going about things. However, in a situation like this, a special operations force like the Aden Vanguard can't engage in a mass operation, so the Kingdom's Royal Guard's approach is necessary, you might say. What brings you here, though?<br>

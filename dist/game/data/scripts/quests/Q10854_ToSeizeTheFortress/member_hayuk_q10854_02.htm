The report... oh yeah!<br>
It appears that Logart doesn't believe in my intelligence or my skills, since he's asking me to submit so many reports.<br>
Of course, I understand that it's because Logart's operation requires very close coordination.<br>
Anyways, since you're all the way out here for the report, I have no choice but to hand it over. Here you go. Tell him that everything's just normal out here.

For now, I want you to visit each of the strongholds, and collect the status reports.<br>
Go to the Aden Vanguard Members Barton, Hayuk, Elise, and Eliyah, who are managing Stronghold I through IV, respectively, and bring back their reports. Once we have all of the reports, then we'll proceed to the next step.<br>
If you've collected all of the Stronghold Status Reports, and find that nothing is wrong in particular, defeat Embryo Quartermaster Hummel on the first level of the fortress, and Embryo Master Artisan Geork on the second level of the fortress, then return to me.

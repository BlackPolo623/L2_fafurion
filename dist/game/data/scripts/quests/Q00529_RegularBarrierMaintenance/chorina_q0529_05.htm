The Energy of the Floating Sea doesn't fall from the sky.<br>
The easiest way to collect the Energy of the Floating Sea is by stealing it from the monsters around here, including Orfen's Handmaiden.<br>
You can get <font color="LEVEL">Seized Energy of the Floating Sea</font> by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Aranea, Keros, Falena, Atrofa, Nuba, Torfedo, Lesatanas, Arbor, Tergus, Skeletus, Arimus, Arima, Harane and Atrofine</font>. I need you to bring me <font color="LEVEL">200</font>.

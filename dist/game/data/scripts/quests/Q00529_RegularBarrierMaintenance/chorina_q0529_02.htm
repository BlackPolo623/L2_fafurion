The barrier here is unique so I need a skillful adventurer who can help me every day. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't feel safe leaving the barrier's maintenance to you. I'd appreciate it if you could come back stronger.<br>
(This quest is for characters Lv. 106 and higher who have completed the Ivory Tower's Research - Floating Sea Journal quest.)

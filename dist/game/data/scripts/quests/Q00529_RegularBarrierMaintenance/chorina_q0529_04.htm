We created the barrier at the Sea of Spores using the Energy of the Floating Sea because no matter how strong our barrier was, it wasn't enough to keep the Energy of the Floating Sea from spreading. The energy never settles in one place; it keeps moving, trying to spread whenever it has the chance.<br>
And Orfen's Handmaiden is collecting the Energy of the Floating Sea for Orfen, so the energy is never in balance.<br>
Which means it needs constant maintenance. Repeating the same thing every day is tiring but I know what will happen if I don't, so I can't take a break. This is why I need your help.<br>

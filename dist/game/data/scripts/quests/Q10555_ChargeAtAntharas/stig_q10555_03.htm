<html><body>Balthus Knight Captain Stig Mach:<br>
I assume you already know. But we, the Balthus Knights, were established to defeat Antharas. To our shame, we tried many times to expel Antharas but have failed. We have succeeded in weakening Antharas.<br>
We are about to leave for another battle against Antharas. I know you are unexperienced, but if you and your friend Tarti fight together as a team, I'm sure you can fight just as well as other Balthus Knights.<br>

Orfen was responsible for perhaps the most important thread: the Thread of the Future. But she chose to revolt and tried to become the leader of the Aracnas, taking charge of all past, present and future.<br>
There was a huge conflict. Orfen realized her power was not suffice so she started building power here, the Sea of Spores.<br>
Orfen is still building her power using the Energy of the Floating Sea. Since the Sea of Spores expanded, she is giving everything she has to build even more power.<br>
The scream that Bacon heard must have been the sound of her order to collect more Energy of the Floating Sea.<br>
We can't just allow Orfen to gather strength. Who knows what could happen if she seized control of the three threads of destiny? If you have the skills and allies, please end Orfen's ambition and bring stability to this world.

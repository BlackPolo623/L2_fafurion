If you have the skills and allies, please make Orfen pay for her sins of abandoning her responsibility and trying to seize the three threads of destiny for her own.<br>
Orfen is currently stuck in her own nest located at the deepest part of the Sea of Spores due to barriers that we Ivory Tower Wizards erected. You can find her there.

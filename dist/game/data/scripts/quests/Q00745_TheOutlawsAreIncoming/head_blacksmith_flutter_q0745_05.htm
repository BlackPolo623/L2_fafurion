You will be helping out in the Oren Territory. I will be assigning you to a task that has been troubling the are for a long time. Once you complete the mission, you'll be going immediately to the next area. You should know that once you've accepted the mission, you won't be running into me again for a while even if you come out. If you've understood everything, I'll get you started up on the mission.<br>

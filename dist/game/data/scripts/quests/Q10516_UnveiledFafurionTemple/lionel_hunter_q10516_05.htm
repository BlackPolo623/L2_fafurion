Yes, despite all risks, the Ivory Tower decided to send a gatekeeper. Because the temple is really dangerous, you can get there only through <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Flauen</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font>.<br>
Ask Gatekeeper Flauen to teleport you to the <font color="LEVEL">Fafurion Temple.</font> To return to Heine, you should find <font color="LEVEL">Frederick</font>; he was sent to the temple to support the advance unit.<br>
If you find him, Frederick will tell you what to do.

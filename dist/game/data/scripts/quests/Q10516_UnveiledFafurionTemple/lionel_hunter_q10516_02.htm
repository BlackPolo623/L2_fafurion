<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
The fact that Fafurion revealed his temple on the surface means that we will face a threat that we've never seen before.<br>
The situation is very complicated, and so we need capable people who are skilled enough to deal with Fafurion.<br>
I'm afraid you're not one of them. You need to grow more.<br>
(This quest is for characters Lv. 110 and higher.)

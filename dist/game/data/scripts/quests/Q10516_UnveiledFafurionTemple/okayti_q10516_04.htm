Hahaha, I like you. There's something I should tell you, though.<br>
In the deepest part of the Fafurion Temple lies the Heart of Tsunami, which leads to the Fafurion's Nest. Even if you manage to get to the heart, you can't enter the Fafurion's Nest if you don't have the <font color="LEVEL">Pontus Stone</font>. The Fafurion's Nest is filled with Fafurion's energy. Without the stone, you can't survive there. Oh, not everyone needs to have the stone. For a punitive force, only its leader needs the Pontus Stone.<br>
There are many more things I'd like to tell you. But for now, let's have some rest and talk again.<br>

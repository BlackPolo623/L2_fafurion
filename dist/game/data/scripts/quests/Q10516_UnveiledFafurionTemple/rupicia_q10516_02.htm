Did you talk with Frederick?<br>
I have been waiting for you to tell you about the Fafurion Temple.<br>
The temple is divided into four zones. One of them is connected to the Fafurion's Nest. Okayti knows more about that zone.<br>
The other three zones are occupied by Fafurion's minions. The zones are slightly different from one another. Consider your current situation and each zone's features when facing Fafurion's minions.<br>

Do you remember when you first chose a path for yourself and went forth? Each of the areas where you carried out missions at the time are looking for explorers like yourself, for their own reasons. It's a win-win: You can follow a path you already know and grow even further, and those assigning the missions to you can have their problems solved.<br>
Isn't that right?<br>

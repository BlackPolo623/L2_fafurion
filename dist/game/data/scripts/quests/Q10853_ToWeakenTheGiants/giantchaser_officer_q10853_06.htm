We need your strength to subjugate the Giants.<br>
I don't remember whether you have experience taking on Mimir. The frightening thing, though, is that Mimir has managed to resurrect not only himself but his minions as well.<br>
First, in order to weaken Mimir, you'll have to slay the minions he has summoned.<br>
The Mimillions, who are Mimir's minions, will appear when Mimir calls. When they do, take the opportunity to slay Mimir as well.<br>
Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Mimillion Bathus, Mimillion Carcass, and Mimillion Kshana</font> summoned by Mimir, then return.

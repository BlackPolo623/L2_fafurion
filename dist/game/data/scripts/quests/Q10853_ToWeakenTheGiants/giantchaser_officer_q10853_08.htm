You have slayed all of the Mimillions. I'm afraid there's some bad news, though.<br>
Emperor Helios has issued his orders, and Mimir has returned, stronger than ever. Unless the Enhanced Mimir is defeated, our safety cannot be guaranteed.<br>
Please slay the <font color="LEVEL">Enhanced Mimir</font>.<br>
Also, after the Enhanced Mimir reveals himself, they say that the Superion Scouts might appear as well.<br>
You must not let the Superion Scouts <font color="LEVEL">Delta Bathus, Delta Carcass, and Delta Kshana</font> roam about freely in the Giant's Cave. Take out <font color="LEVEL">200</font> each of the <font color="LEVEL">Delta Bathus, Delta Carcass, and Delta Kshana</font>.

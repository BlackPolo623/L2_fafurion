<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Helios ruled over the skies and the earth. However, after suffering a huge blow in the war against the gods, he lay formant for a long time. He has only just now woken, up which means we should have a fighting chance.<br>
Plus, we are not the pathetic races we once used to be. We shall not be enslaved helplessly like we were in the past.<br>
While Helios is of course going to still be a formidable opponent, during the long time he was asleep, we have grown sufficiently powerful. Isn't that right?<br>
Let us bring our powers together to defeat <font color="LEVEL">Helios</font>, and bring about a world where the masters of the skies and the earth are us.

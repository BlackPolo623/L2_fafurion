I hope, when the issues in the Fairy Settlement are stabilized a little, the problems in the Enchanted Valley will naturally be solved. However, all of us are so busy. That's why I'm here. Frankly, I'm not strong enough to fight against strong monsters and I usually assist other Mother Tree Guardians. At the very least, I can support others trying to solve the problem. So... will you help me?<br>

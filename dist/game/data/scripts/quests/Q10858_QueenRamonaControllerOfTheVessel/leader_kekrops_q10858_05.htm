<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
It should be either Emperor Helios or his wife Queen Ramona controlling the Superion.<br>
Ramona was a grand wizard and scholar. When she became queen, she became Helios' right hand, and gained greater powers.<br>
It's obvious from the fact that Helios trusted Ramona with controlling the Superion. However, by taking out Ramona, we may be able to control Superion. Please go and bring Ramona down.<br>
Remember, you cannot go after Ramona alone. You must join forces with many comrades.

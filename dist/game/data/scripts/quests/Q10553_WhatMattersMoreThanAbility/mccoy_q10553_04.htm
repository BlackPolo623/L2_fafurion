<html><body>Hatchling Manager McCoy:<br>
What, are you afraid of Hatchlings? I've heard you are good enough to deal with them.<br>
Come on. Show me your ability. The Hatchlings under my control will be a good match for you.<br>
I don't mean you have to deal with them alone. A weird boy called Tarti or Tart has been bothering me, questioning about the nature of Hatchlings. You should team up with him.<br>
How about starting it now, or do you need more time?<br>

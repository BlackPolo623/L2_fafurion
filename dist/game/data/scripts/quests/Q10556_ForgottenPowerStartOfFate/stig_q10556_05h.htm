<html><body>Balthus Knight Captain Stig Mach:<br>
I knew you were interested in gaining greater power and working in a wider world. I noticed <font color="LEVEL">Lakcis' Power</font> from you when you fought Antharas. So, I decided to help you assimilate that power.<br>
In Talking Island Village lies the Tomb of Souls, where you can learn how to improve your skill and power. I'll send you there.<br>
I'm sure you will be an invaluable resource to the Balthus Knights, but I shouldn't confine you here. You are meant to make heroic feats in a bigger world. Maybe one day, we will meet again and fight together against Antharas. Now, are you ready to gain greater power?<br>

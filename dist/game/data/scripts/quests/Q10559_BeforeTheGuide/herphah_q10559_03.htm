I have the perfect job for your current skill level.<br>
You've made great progress, but only under the protection of the Balthus Knights. You know nothing about the real world. I can't be always with you to explain every single detail. You should learn about Aden and its people through experience, not through words.<br>
So, I'd like to recommend a mission. Follow my instructions and start the <font color="LEVEL">Way of Wandering Knight</font> and perform the missions of the <font color="LEVEL">Adventure Guild</font>. With this, you should be able to pass off as an informed individual.

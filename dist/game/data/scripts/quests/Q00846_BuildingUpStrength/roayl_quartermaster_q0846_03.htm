I heard that last time, you helped Elikia over there, helping to rescue the Blackbird Clan captives.<br>
Actually, they weren't the only captives. We have confirmed that some of Kingdom's Royal Guard and the citizens of Aden have been incarcerated by the Embryo, and are being worked to the bone.<br>
Some of them may be enlisted with us immediately after they are rescued.<br>

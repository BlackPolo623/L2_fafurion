<html><body>Advance Unit Lupicia:<br>
This place where we're talking is safe, but the others are extremely dangerous. Only the skilled and confident can survive.<br>
You look confident in your abilities, but I'm afraid you're not skilled enough to fight here. I recommend you come back when you are stronger. To return to Heine, talk to Frederick over there.<br>
(This quest is for characters of Lv. 110 and higher who have completed the "Unveiled Fafurion Temple" quest.)

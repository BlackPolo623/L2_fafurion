<html><body>Advance Unit Lupicia:<br>
This area is mainly divided into three zones, except the one connected to Fafurion's Nest.<br>
There is no clear boundary, but you can easily distinguish each zone because its difficulty is clearly different.<br>
Where we are standing is a kind of entrance. As you get closer to Fafurion's Nest, you will encounter stronger enemies. Do you want to check it out personally?<br>

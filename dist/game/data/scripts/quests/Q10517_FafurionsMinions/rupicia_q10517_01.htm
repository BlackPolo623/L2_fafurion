Did you learn more about the Fafurion Temple?<br>
This place is different from other areas in Aden. It was under the sea until recently.<br>
However, the greatest difference is that the monsters here are Fafurion's minions that he personally bestowed power upon.<br>
The mere sight of these horrible creatures could strike fear into the entire continent.<br>
Their presence itself confirms how difficult it will be to suppress Fafurion. But I believe we can exert greater power when facing stronger enemies. Am I right?<br>

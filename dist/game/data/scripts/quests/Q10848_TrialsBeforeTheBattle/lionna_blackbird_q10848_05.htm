That is why I'd like to check one last time if you are ready for the showdown. Only those who have passed the test and proven their skills and trustworthiness will be chosen. Only those who pass will take on Beleth with me.<br>
It's the last trial, you could say. You are qualified to have a go, and I will ask you one last time. What do you say? Will you take on the last trial before the showdown?<br>

Looks like you haven't found out yet. Please find out what Arima and Arimus are doing with the Energy of the Floating Sea. I just can't remember.<br>
Come to think of it, when Arima and Arimus start to drain the Energy of the Floating Sea, you have to take them out before they can finish. If you don't, they'll take the energy to Orfen.

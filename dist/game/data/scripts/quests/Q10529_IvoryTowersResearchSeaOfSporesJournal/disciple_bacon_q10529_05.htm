<html><body>Paterson's Disciple Bacon:<br>
I was working on my research before the Sea of Spores changed. A different kind of Energy of the Floating Sea may have contaminated the journal.<br>
I think the monsters affected by the Sea of Spores might have mistaken it for food. But I can't just lose my precious journal to being some monster's snack.<br>
I'm sure monsters took it, so please hunt <font color="LEVEL">Keros, Falena, Atrofa, Nuba, Torfedo, Aranea, Harane, Lesatanas, Arbor, Tergus, Skeletus, Atrofine, Orfen's Handmaiden Arimus and Orfen's Handmaiden Arima</font> and gather <font color="LEVEL">100 pages of the Floating Sea Journal</font>.

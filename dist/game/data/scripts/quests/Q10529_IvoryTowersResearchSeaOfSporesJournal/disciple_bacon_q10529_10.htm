<html><body>Paterson's Disciple Bacon:<br>
Did you find out?<br>
The Energy of the Floating Sea... Ah! Not exactly. It's Dispersing Energy of the Floating Sea. Maybe because the Energy of the Floating Sea is unstable?<br>
I'm now certain that Arima and Arimus are collecting the Energy of the Floating Sea. Hmm... I'll have to look further into this. I have to find out why Orfen is having her maidens collecting the Energy of the Floating Sea.<br>
Thank you for your help. Will you please accept this small gift?<br>

Ah, maybe I was hurrying a bit too much. Alright, I'll tell you about the quest. The Forsaken Plains have been traveled by many. It's not surprising, since they're that important. However, the recent increasing number of monsters feels rather strange. If we are unable to defend the area, we'll be in quite a pickle. Obviously, the quest that Paterson spoke of will become difficult.<br>
So I'd like you to reduce the number of monsters around here. Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stalker, Marsh Drake, Fallen Orc, Ancient Gargoyle, Fallen Orc Archer, Fallen Orc Shaman, Sharp Talon Tiger, and Fallen Orc Captain</font>, and collect <font color="LEVEL">120 Marks of the Plains Monster</font>. Then, in the plateau area down there, slay the <font color="LEVEL">Yintzu, Paliote, Hamrut, and Kranrot</font>, and collect <font color="LEVEL">120 Marks of the Plateau Monster</font>.<br>

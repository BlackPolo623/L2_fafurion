I would tell you again. Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stalker, Marsh Drake, Fallen Orc, Ancient Gargoyle, Fallen Orc Archer, Fallen Orc Shaman, Sharp Talon Tiger, and Fallen Orc Captain</font>, and collect <font color="LEVEL">120 Marks of the Plains Monster</font>. Then, in the plateau area down there, slay the <font color="LEVEL">Yintzu, Paliote, Hamrut, and Kranrot</font>, and collect <font color="LEVEL">120 Marks of the Plateau Monster</font>.<br>
After you collect the two types of marks, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font> and look for a <font color="LEVEL">Paterson</font>. Well, that's all I have to tell you. Now off you go, for real this time!!!

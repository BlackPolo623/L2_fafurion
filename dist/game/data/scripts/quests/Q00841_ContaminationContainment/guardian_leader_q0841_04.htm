At first, we believed we could stop the contamination with the aid of Mother Tree Guardians and Adventurers...<br>
But we failed, and the contamination only got worse. We don't know why, but one thing is for sure. If we do nothing, the contamination will spread further and cause a more serious problems.<br>
We must take action immediately. Would you help us prevent the spreading of the contamination?<br>

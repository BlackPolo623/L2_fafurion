Thank you for helping me. Currently, the contamination is spreading through Flower Buds. We need to engage in purging the flower buds.<br>
If a Flower Bud is already contaminated, using the Purified Water will cause an Enraged Nymph to appear. You must defeat the Enraged Nymphs so that they do not spread through the Enchanted Valley, taking the contamination with them.<br>

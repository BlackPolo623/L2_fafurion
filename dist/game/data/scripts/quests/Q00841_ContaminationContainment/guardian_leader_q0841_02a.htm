<html><body>Guardian Irene:<br>
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure whether I can trust you with this mission.<br>
Until I can trust that you will work together with and not against the Mother Tree Guardians, I cannot put you on assignment.<br>
(This quest can only be undertaken by characters whose faction level with the Mother Tree Guardians is 2 or higher.)

Well done. You may be unable to perform the priestess role since you are not one of Parme's kin. Nevertheless, you have proven your determination and ability to go through the difficult path that the priestesses followed.<br>
Without any priestesses, Fafurion is practicing to control his anger by himself and gain more power.<br>
Fortunately for us, you have grown so far as to absorb some of the power of contract unknowingly. You will be of great help when we fight Fafurion.<br>
Take this. I've prepared it to help you get ready for the fight against Fafurion. I hope to have you beside us when fighting Fafurion.

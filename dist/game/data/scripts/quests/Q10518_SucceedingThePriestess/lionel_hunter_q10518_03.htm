<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
The moment Fafurion woke up, Parme realized that Beleth had deceived her.<br>
She did everything to appease Fafurion's anger, but Fafurion didn't forgive her for neglecting her duty.<br>
Before she died, she told me how her kin had obtained the ability to calm Fafurion.<br>
I'm an Eva's Knight, though. I can't take over a priestess's job. I have to find a warrior who can succeed her.<br>

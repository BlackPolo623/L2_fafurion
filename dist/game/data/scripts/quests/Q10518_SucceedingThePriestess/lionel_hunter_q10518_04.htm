Do you want to succeed the priestess? If so, I must confirm your resolution.<br>
You must be familiar with Krofins. Eva sealed them when they were about to entrust themselves to Fafurion, but somehow they succeeded in receiving Krofin's power. Prove your determination by checking out how much the Krofin race has evolved.<br>

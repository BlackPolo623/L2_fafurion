Priestess Parme was able to calm Fafurion, as well as his minions. Before Parme died, she spoke of the contract inscribed in the bloods of her kin and Fafurion. Now that she is dead, I guess the connection is weakening.<br>
Fafurion's minions in the Fafurion Temple have been even further influenced by Fafurion. You can get the <font color="LEVEL">Broken Contract Fragments</font> from them.<br>
Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Temple Guard Captain, Temple Guardian Captain, Temple Guard Member, Temple Knight Recruit, Temple Guard, Temple Guardian Warrior, Temple Wizard, Temple Guardian Wizard, and Hungry Water Dragon</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Fafurion Temple</font> and gather <font color="LEVEL">30</font> <font color="LEVEL">Broken Contract Fragments</font>.

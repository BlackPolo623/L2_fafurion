You understand what I mean. We feared Shilen and we still do. But we shouldn't miss this chance. Shilen is inactive, and if we pull together, we'll be able to weaken her power.<br>
My plan is to defeat Shilen's minions, <font color="LEVEL">Anakim and Lilith</font> so that Shilen can never make such a terrible mess again.<br>
If you agree, go defeat one of them.

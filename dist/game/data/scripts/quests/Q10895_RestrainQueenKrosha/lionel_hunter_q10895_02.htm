<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
Recent changes make me really anxious. I'm afraid Fafurion might be soon awakened.<br>
Eva was deeply concerned about Fafurion's movement. We cannot expect her help any more, though. We should do it ourselves. However, it seems that you are not skilled enough for this mission. Train yourself more and then come back.<br>
(This quest is for characters Lv. 107 and higher.)

<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
The queen is vital in a colony of Krofins. When the queen stops moving, they do too. When the queen gives an order, they follow it immediately without question. That's how they went to hibernation all together.<br>
Therefore, the most effective way of stopping Krofins is to restrain Queen Krosha.<br>
Queen Krosha once decided to work for Fafurion in return for the safety of her colony. The fact that Queen Krosha has become active means that something may have happened to Fafurion.<br>
Neither is good news for us, though. For now, we must focus on stopping Krofins. To do so, we must first suppress Queen Krosha. However great of a warrior you are, you cannot deal with Krofins alone. I recommend you go with your friends. After forming a party, let your leader speak to me. Then I'll send your party to the Krofin's Nest.

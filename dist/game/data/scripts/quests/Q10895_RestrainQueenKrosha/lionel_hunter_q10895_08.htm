<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
Thank you. We'll be able to keep peace here, at least for a while. I wish I could hear Eva's voice again before greater danger finds us...<br>
It is hard to predict the Krofins' next move, but I am sure that Eva is pleased with your service.<br>
I've prepared a small gift as a reward. I hope you find it useful.

<html><body>Fairy citizen who ran away from Kimerian:<br>
Did you take care of them?<br>
I guess reward is in order...<br>
You didn't take the <font color="LEVEL">Adventure Guild's mission</font>. Or you received one but didn't get confirmation from me. In either case, if you choose to get the reward and finish this mission, you can't complete the Adventure Guild's mission. At least not today.<br>
You'd better check the mission first and talk to me again.<br>
(If you complete the quest and the <font color="LEVEL">Basic Mission: Forest of Fairies</font> quest, you can earn additional reward and Amity Points.)<br>

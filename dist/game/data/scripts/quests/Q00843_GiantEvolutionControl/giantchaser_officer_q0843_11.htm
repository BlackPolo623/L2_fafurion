It appears that you have not yet defeated 50 Marred Giants. However, you must finish what you've taken on. In that case, use the <font color="LEVEL">Pursuers' Shine Stone</font> to accelerate the giants' evolution in the area where the Shine Stone Crystal lies.<br>
This is how <font color="LEVEL">Giants' Evolution</font> works. The Root of the Lesser Giant and the Essence of the Lesser Giants evolve, becoming a Lesser Giant. They evolve again, and what results is the recovering Lesser Giant.<br>
However, the <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Giants</font> do not always evolve into recovering lesser giants. <font color="LEVEL">Sometimes, the evolution is marred</font>. If you come across the <font color="LEVEL">Marred Bathus, Marred Carcass, or the Marred Kshana</font>, just slay <font color="LEVEL">50</font> of them.

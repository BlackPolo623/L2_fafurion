We have succeeded in creating the Shine Stone of the Pursuers, using the Shinedust that we have collected until now. But what we've created is rather different from the Minion's Shine Stone, and you must be careful when using it. <br>
The Pursuers' Shine Stone activates the Shine Stone Crystal. Wherever the Shine Stone Crystal is, the giants there can be made to evolve. However, when they are made to evolve in this manner, we've found that the Lesser Giants' evolution sometimes ends up becoming marred.<br>
We've also found out that evolving Lesser Giants into Marred Giants is to our advantage.<br>

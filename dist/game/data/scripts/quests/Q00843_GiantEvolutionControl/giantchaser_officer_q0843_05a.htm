Marred Giants are unable to evolve any further, so they stop evolving. If a Marred Giant is slayed, that does away with the risk of them joining forces with the giants. <br>
That's why we're going to slay the Marred Giants. Of course, you can select how much of a workload you can manage. Interested?<br>

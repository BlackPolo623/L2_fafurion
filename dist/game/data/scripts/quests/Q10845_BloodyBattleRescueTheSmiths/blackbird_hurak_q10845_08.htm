Great! Devianne said that the blacksmiths have been rescued.<br>
I just saw someone come out of the forge  and go to the <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor</font>, so if we are lucky we might be able to see <font color="LEVEL">Burnstein</font>.<br>
If you have some free time, I would appreciate it if you can help us defeat the head too.

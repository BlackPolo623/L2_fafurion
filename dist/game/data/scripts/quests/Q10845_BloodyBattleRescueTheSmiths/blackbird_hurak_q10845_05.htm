Yes. A lot of blacksmiths have been taken captive and are being forced to work like slaves.<br>
I heard that the blacksmiths who have been taken captive are <font color="LEVEL">Karrod, Aios, Brunon, Sumari, and Lansia</font>. It looks like <font color="LEVEL">Lansia</font> is being kept close to <font color="LEVEL">Geork</font>, the head blacksmith.<br>
I'll give you another tip. If you get rid of <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Geork</font>, it will <font color="LEVEL">affect the other Embryo soldiers</font>, so you better remember that when you deal with them.

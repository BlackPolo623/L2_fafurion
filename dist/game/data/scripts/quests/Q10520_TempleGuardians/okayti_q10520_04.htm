It's called Pontus Stone.<br>
The stone contains the power of huge waves. The path to the Fafurion's Nest is filled with Fafurion's energy. Even Fafurion's own minions can't go through it.<br>
Fafurion gave the stone to Chief Gatekeeper Cyrax so that his men could come to his nest more quickly when he needed them.<br>
When it is moved away a certain distance, the Pontus Stone automatically returns to Cyrax.<br>
